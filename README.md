# WheelSpin
Wheel Spinner made for a community service organization hosting a raffle event. Design of the program was catered to the requests of the event organizer.
Functionality:
  Wheel has an input section where one enters in names and tickets associated with that person.
  Once the "Create Wheel" button is pressed, a spinnable wheel with weighted sections based on the ticket amount is created.
  The wheel will spin once it is clicked on and will display the winner once the spinning ends.
  The user has an option to recreate the wheel without the winner and adjusted weights after each spin.
